# Clicker Game

Welcome to the Clicker Game! This is a simple game where the player has to click a button to earn points and progress through 5 different levels. Each level has a different enemy and target number of clicks to reach. The game also includes a registration form that collects the user's name and email address with basic validation.

How to Play

To play the game, simply click on the enemy to earn points. The score will be displayed on the screen at all times, so you can keep track of your progress. When you reach the target number of clicks for a level, a message will be displayed on the screen congratulating you on reaching the next level. After you win all 5 levels you can restart your game.

How to Run Locally

To run the project you can use a local server. One way to do this is to use the http-server package:
1. Download or clone the project from GitHub to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory.
3. If you have node.js installed, you can use a local server to serve the files. If you don't have it, download it and install it on your computer.
4. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the command "npm install -g http-server" to install the local server.
6. After installation, run the command "http-server" in the terminal.
7. Open your web browser and go to "http://localhost:8080" to play the game.

Alternatively, if you don't want to use a local web server, you can simply open the index.html file in your web browser directly by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Open with Live Server" from the context menu. This will start a local server and open the game in your default browser. Note that you may need to install the Live Server extension for VS Code before you can use this method.

Enjoy playing the game!
